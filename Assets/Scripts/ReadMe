Setup Grid Manager

REQUIRED OBJECTS IN HIERARCHY
- GridGenerator (Empty object) with following scripts:
    - LevelInitializer
        - Grid Base Prefab = FloorPrefab (Quad with grid material)
        - Unit Prefab = PlayerModel (only prefab, PlayerModel is not in hierarchy)
        - Unit Count: Number of units to spawn
        - Unit Offset: Multiple for Unit spawn location
    - LevelManager
        - LvlObjects
            - This is supposed to hold all objects on the map
            - Can create multiple lists for multiple floors (Floor Index)
            - But, this needs fixing
    - PlayerInteractions
        - ActiveUnit = Unit current in player's control (Drop in during runtime for now)
        - HasPath/HoldPath: Do not toggle
        - VisualizePath: If you want the path line to render
        - LineGO: The line object with the LineRenderer attached
- Grid (Prefab) with scripts:
    - GridBase
        - Set grid dimensions using MaxX/Y/Z
        - Offset values is if FloorPrefab (quad) has been scaled larger
        - GridFloorPrefab = FloorPrefab
    - PathfindMaster
        - MaxJobs = Number of threads to open during initializing/runtime

Map objects need LevelObject Script attached:
- Set floor objects with Obj Type: Floor
- Set outside walls with Obj Type: Wall
- Set obstacles (rocks, trees, etc.) with Obj Type: Obstacle

FloorPrefab:
- FloorMesh needs NodeReferences Script
    - Default material = GridOutline
    - Tile Materials = Walkable, unwalkable (needs fixing)

Line Prefab:
- Empty object with Line Renderer Component
- Colour can be anything

PlayerObject:
- UnitController script
    - Speed is for the Animator component
- UnitStates script
    - Variables are used later (presumably)
    - Moving Speed is set here
